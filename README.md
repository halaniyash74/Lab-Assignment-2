# Lab-Assignment-2
These python files are based on the breast cancer diagnostic dataset and machine learning algorithms are performed on the dataset to find out the model best suited for it. Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine algorithms are performed and it is found that the Support Vector Machine algorithm provides better accuracy.
